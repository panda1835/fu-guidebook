# Fulbright Ultimate Frisbee Guidebook

The Fulbright Ultimate Frisbee Guidebook is a digital book where you can find information from basic game rule to advanced techniques about Ultimate Frisbee. The content of this guidebook is created and edited by the Fulbright Ultimate (FU) team.

Although Ultimate is a popular sport in Europe and the US, it is a new sport in Vietnam. So, this project is our endeavor to popularize this friendly, non-contact, opponent-respect, and mix-gender sport in Vietnam. Therefore, the book is composed completely in Vietnamese (with English translation in brackets if needed) so that no Vietnamese people is left behind in the game just because of their language barrier.
